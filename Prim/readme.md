# Prim Algorithm

## Description
- Instances of the problem are in the folder [instances](./instances)
- The file [gabarito_agm.txt](./gabarito_agm.txt) contains the solutions of the instances

## How to use

To execute the program, compile the binaries. If needed, update the file names at the beginning of the script [Bat1.sh](./Bat1.sh).

```bash
$ make
```

To execute the test series, run the following command:
```bash
$ ./Bat1.sh
```

If you want to execute the program with a single instance, run the following command:
```bash
$ ./prim.bin -f <instance_file>
```

You can write -h to see the help message:
```bash
$ ./prim.bin -h
```

## Input file format

The input file must be in the following format:

```
<number_of_nodes> <number_of_edges>
<origin_node> <destination_node> <edge_weight>
<origin_node> <destination_node> <edge_weight>
